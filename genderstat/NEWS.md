## CRAN resubmission

### Major Changes

- Modified the `DESCRIPTION` file to address CRAN feedback:
  - Removed the package name from the beginning of the `Title` field and ensured it's in title case.
  - Updated the `Description` field to not start with the package name or 'This package'.
  - Adjusted the `License` to only ship the CRAN template for the MIT license.
  - Updated the `Author` field to provide details using the `person()` format, including ORCID.
